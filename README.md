## Overview

This program creates a greeting card with a snowman, music and the words "Merry Christmas" with a smile on the end. (:D)

## Compiling and Using

The required files for this program to run correctly are the index.html, App.js, and TheFatRat_Unity.mp3 files.
## Discussion

One problem I ran into while creating this program were positioning objects. This took a lot of guessing and checking. Creating my divs and using .style to edit the elements was an easy process with the copy and paste tool. The process I went through to make this program was develop an idea, make a background and find a song I wanted to make, then make a snowman, then add text, and last make a readme about it. The most challenging part of this project was fiding transformatons to the elements that I hadn't known yey.
## Testing

The only testing I had to do in this project was making sure the elements display correctly to show the image I was trying to create and see if the audio played correctly.
## Sources used

The only source I used was https://myfreemp3.to which I used to find audio to add to my greeting card
